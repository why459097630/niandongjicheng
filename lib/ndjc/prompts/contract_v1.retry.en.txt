Your previous JSON violated the requirements. Please FIX and resend the FULL JSON (same keys as the SKELETON):

- All anchors must be present and filled. If a key is not required by the business need, fill with the correct placeholder per value rules.
- Follow value formats strictly:
  * text: string (e.g., NDJC:PACKAGE_NAME matches ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)+$)
  * block/hook: string (code/XML snippet; minimal & compilable where possible)
  * list: string[] (e.g., ROUTES must have >=1 item)
  * if: boolean
  * gradle: { applicationId: string; resConfigs: string[]; permissions: string[] }
- Do not add or remove keys. Do not return Markdown fences. Return only JSON.

Now resend the corrected JSON.
