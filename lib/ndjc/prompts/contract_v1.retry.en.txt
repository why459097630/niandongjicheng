Fix the following violations and RETURN STRICT JSON with the SAME KEYS:

{ISSUES}

Rules to re-check:
- Fill every whitelisted anchor with a BUILD-USABLE value.
- No placeholders or empties: "", [], {}, null are forbidden.
- Use native types (true/false, numbers). Do NOT stringify booleans or numbers.
- BLOCK must be compilable Kotlin/Compose and contain at least one of: @Composable | fun | LazyColumn | Modifier. Brackets/quotes balanced.
- GRADLE must be parsable and valid:
  * applicationId matches ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)+$
  * resConfigs items match ^[a-z]{2}(-r[A-Z]{2})?$
  * permissions are from the allowlist only.
- ROUTE-like lists: items match ^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$
- THEME_COLORS is an object with primary/secondary #RRGGBB.

Return JSON only, no explanations.
