Your previous JSON violated the required keys and/or value formats.

Fix strictly and resend the **full JSON**:
- Use exactly the same key set and structure as the SKELETON (no additions, no deletions).
- For every anchor, if not applicable, fill with its placeholder (per the rules).
- Respect all type/enum/pattern constraints in the value rules.

Missing/invalid last time: {{MISSING}}
Hint: Respect placeholders for Block/Hook/List/If and Gradle fields as described in the rules.
