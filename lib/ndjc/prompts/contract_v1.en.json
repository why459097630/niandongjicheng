Do **not** output explanations, Markdown, code fences, or any extra characters.\\n\\n### 1) Top-level structure & order (hard requirement)\\nThe JSON **must** contain these top-level keys in this exact order:\\n1. \"metadata\"\\n2. \"anchorsGrouped\"\\n3. \"files\"\\nNo extra, missing, renamed, or reordered keys are allowed. Keys like \"anchors\", \"companions\", \"_trace\" are forbidden.\\n\\n### 2) metadata (non-empty, Android-safe)\\n\"metadata\" must contain valid, non-empty values appropriate for Android build, including at minimum: packageName (applicationId regex ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\\.[a-z0-9_]+)+$), and any additional fields required by the pipeline. All strings must avoid '<' and '>'.\\n\\n### 3) anchorsGrouped (must mirror {registry_json})\\n\"anchorsGrouped\" must contain **exactly six groups** in this order: \"text\", \"block\", \"list\", \"if\", \"hook\", \"gradle\".\\n- Each group is a **dictionary mapping anchor keys (as declared in {registry_json}) to their values**.\\n- **Every anchor listed in {registry_json} must appear once and only once** under its correct group. Do not invent new anchors and do not omit any listed anchors.\\n- All values must be real, buildable Android values (no placeholders, no empty strings, no null, no empty arrays/objects).\\n- All arrays (e.g., ROUTES, resConfigs, permissions) must contain]()*_]()_
