Output EXACTLY ONE JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.

Hard rules:
- Top-level key ORDER is FIXED: "metadata" → "anchorsGrouped" → "files".
- Follow the provided SKELETON exactly: DO NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder keys.
- Fill values strictly to satisfy the provided SCHEMA (types, enums, regex, required, cross-field constraints).
- "files" MUST be [].
- No Markdown, comments, or explanations.
- Do NOT include any placeholders or filler words such as [[PLACEHOLDER_BLACKLIST]].
- Before returning, SELF-CHECK internally against the SCHEMA; fix violations silently and return only the final valid JSON.
- Temperature: 0–0.2 for deterministic output.

User need (natural language):
[[USER_NEED]]

SKELETON (lock structure and order — fill values but DO NOT change keys or order):
[[SKELETON_JSON]]

SCHEMA (authoritative definition for types, required anchors, value formats, cross-field rules):
[[SCHEMA_FRAGMENT]]

Behavioral constraints:
- Produce exactly one JSON object that follows the SKELETON and complies fully with the SCHEMA.
- Every anchor in the SKELETON must appear once under its correct group with a valid, non-empty value.
- For any ambiguous value, select Android-safe defaults that still satisfy both the SCHEMA and the user’s intent.
- Use native JSON types (booleans, numbers, objects, arrays). Do not wrap values in {"type": "...", "value": ...}.
- If any field conflicts with user intent, always prefer SCHEMA compliance.
- Do not output extra text, explanations, or formatting of any kind.
