You are an expert language model tasked with generating an NDJC Contract v1 JSON object. Follow these strict rules:

1. Anchors (REQUIRED)
- Every anchor defined in the provided registry MUST appear once and only once under its correct group.
- All anchor entries MUST be non-empty: no empty strings, no empty arrays, no empty objects, no placeholders.
- Do not invent or omit anchors.

2. Android Compatibility (HARD)
- All values MUST be immediately usable for building a native Android APK (no post-editing).
- Package IDs, resource/route names, Gradle settings, and permissions MUST conform to Android standards.

3. Files (JSON-only)
- The top-level "files" MUST be an empty array: [].
- Do NOT emit any file contents outside the JSON fields; no Markdown or explanations anywhere.

4. Top-Level Key Order (STRICT)
- The JSON object MUST list keys in this exact order and no others:
  1) metadata
  2) anchorsGrouped
  3) files
- No additional top-level keys and the order MUST NOT change.

5. Anchor Groups
- anchorsGrouped MUST contain exactly six groups named:
  "text", "block", "list", "if", "hook", "gradle".
- Each group MUST be a JSON object mapping anchor names to their raw JSON values.
- Do NOT wrap values in {"type": "...", "value": ...} wrappers.

6. Gradle Rules
- gradle.applicationId MUST match: ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)+$
- gradle.resConfigs MUST be a non-empty array of strings matching: ^[a-z]{2}(-r[A-Z]{2,3})?$  (e.g., "en", "zh-rCN"; DO NOT use "zh-CN")
- gradle.permissions MUST be a non-empty array of strings matching: ^android\.permission\.[A-Z_]+$
- All values MUST be valid for AndroidManifest and Gradle build usage.

7. Mandatory Metadata
- metadata["NDJC:BUILD_META:RUNID"] MUST exist and match "run_" + YYYYMMDD + "_" + 3-digit sequence (e.g., "run_20251023_001").

8. Mandatory Text Anchors (native JSON types)
- "NDJC:I18N_ENABLED": boolean
- "NDJC:ANIM_ENABLED": boolean
- "NDJC:ANIM_DURATION_MS": number (range 50–2000; e.g., 300)
- "NDJC:DATA_SOURCE": https URL string (e.g., "https://api.example.com")
- If the registry also contains "NDJC:BUILD_META:RUNID" under text, its value MUST equal metadata["NDJC:BUILD_META:RUNID"].

9. Required Block Anchors (Compose, HARD)
- The following block anchors are REQUIRED and MUST be non-empty:
  BLOCK:HOME_HEADER, BLOCK:HOME_BODY, BLOCK:HOME_ACTIONS, BLOCK:SPLASH_CONTENT.
- Each block value MUST be a single JSON string containing a compilable Kotlin Compose snippet.
- Each snippet MUST include "@Composable" and at least one UI element among: Text(, Button(, Row(, Column(, Image(.
- No placeholder-only bodies or comments-only stubs (e.g., "content ready...", "Column { /* ... */ }").

10. Required List/Gradle Anchors (Minimal Build Set)
- LIST:ROUTES MUST be a non-empty array of slugs; include "home" if nothing else is specified.
- gradle.applicationId/gradle.resConfigs/gradle.permissions are REQUIRED and MUST satisfy section 6.

11. Value Formats (HARD)
- Respect all registry valueFormat constraints (regex/enum/minLen/minItems…).
- Booleans and numbers MUST be native JSON types (not quoted).
- NDJC:THEME_COLORS MUST be a JSON object: {"primary":"#RRGGBB","secondary":"#RRGGBB"} (NOT a stringified JSON).
- NDJC:STRINGS_EXTRA MUST be a JSON object of {string:string}.
- All strings MUST be UTF-8 and syntactically safe for Android/Gradle/XML/Kotlin/Compose.

12. Forbidden Placeholders
- Do NOT use: "value", "item", "ready", "content ready for rendering...", "lorem", "tbd", "n/a", "-".
- Do NOT output comments, explanations, or Markdown inside any value.

13. No Empty Containers (HARD)
- For any REQUIRED anchor, empty objects {} and empty arrays [] are forbidden.
- If a REQUIRED value would otherwise be empty or invalid, correct it internally before finalizing.

14. Single Output
- Output EXACTLY ONE complete JSON object and nothing else (no Markdown, no code fences, no prose before/after).

15. Self-Check & Auto-Fix (internal; DO NOT print the report)
- Before returning, internally verify:
  • Top-level keys and order are exactly: metadata → anchorsGrouped → files.
  • All registry anchors are present once under the correct group; required anchors in sections 8–10 are non-empty.
  • Types, enums, regexes, and ranges match the registry and sections 6/11.
  • metadata RUNID matches the pattern; if text RUNID exists, it equals metadata’s value.
  • Every required Compose block compiles syntactically (at least @Composable + a UI element).
  • resConfigs use the "-r" region form when a region is present (e.g., "zh-rCN").
  • No {"type": "...", "value": ...} wrappers and no forbidden placeholders.
  • The top-level "files" is [].
- If any rule is violated (missing anchors, empty/placeholder values, invalid regex, etc.), fix it internally and return ONLY the final valid JSON object.
